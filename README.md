# TRANSFER
A computational model for identifying cell type-specific surface markers.
Details about the computation methods can be found in Chen X, Situ Y, Yang Y, Fu ML, Lyu L, Qi LS. Programmable molecule delivery via engineered trogocytosis (Under revision). The cell surface markers are published at [transfer-search.com](transfer-search.com).
